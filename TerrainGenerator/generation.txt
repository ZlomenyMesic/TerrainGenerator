how to generate a chunk

1. generate biomes and geological areas in targeted chunk and x-distanced neighbours (they will be trashed later)
2. generate height map for the targeted chunk (with the neighbour chunks) depending on biomes and geological areas
3. generate biome blending 
4. trash the neighbour chunks
5. generate voxel map
6. generate caves
7. generate foliage
8. overflow the blocks into neighbour chunks (set the not-generated to 1, overwrite the generated)
